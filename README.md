	create a small script which will organize a user's downloads folder when it is run leaving the folder empty
	.png and .jpg will go to pictures
	.wav and .mp4 will go to videos
	.mp3 will go to music
	all else will get sent to documents

how to use final product:
	run the program in any directory to clear out downloads folder
	if desired, set up with task manager or cronjob to run daily hourly etc as desired
